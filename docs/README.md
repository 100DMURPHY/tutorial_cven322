# CVEN322: Civil Engineering Systems

Welcome to the interactive platform for **CVEN322**. This platform is designed to provide high-transparency access to engineering concepts through live, interactive visualizations.

## Quick Start: How to Run

The application is distributed as a Python package. You can run it directly from GitHub using `uvx` without installing anything locally.

### One-Line Run
If you have `uv` installed, run:
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/100DMURPHY/tutorial_cven322.git cven-app
```
