# Sustainability in Engineering

The Sustainability module provides tools to understand the environmental and social impacts of engineering decisions.

## Pillars of Sustainability
This interactive tool visualizes the intersection of Economic, Social, and Environmental factors. True sustainability is achieved only at the intersection of all three.

### Key Terms:
- **Viable**: Economic + Environmental
- **Bearable**: Social + Environmental
- **Equitable**: Economic + Social

## Weak vs. Strong Sustainability
This section explores the degree of **substitutability** between human-made and natural capital:
- **Weak Sustainability**: The "Substitutability" model. Assumes that natural capital (e.g., fossil fuels, biodiversity) can be replaced by human-made capital (e.g., technology, infrastructure) as long as the total capital stock increases.
- **Strong Sustainability**: The "Complementarity" model. Assumes that certain natural capital is critical, life-supporting, and non-substitutable. It must be preserved independently of technological growth.

## Project Carbon Calculator
A decision-support tool to estimate the embodied carbon of a project based on material selections.
- **Concrete**: High carbon footprint due to cement production.
- **Steel**: Significant energy required for smelting.
- **Timber**: Can act as a carbon sink (negative emissions) if sourced sustainably.
- **Asphalt**: Lower embodied carbon than concrete but derived from petroleum.
